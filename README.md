# hmpps-prisoner-finance-ui

A Digital Prison Services (DPS) frontend application used by prison staff to view and manage prisoner finances.

This service provides the user interface for staff to access prisoner account balances (Spends, Private Cash, and Savings) and view transaction histories.

### Dependencies

### HMPPS Auth

To allow authenticated users to access your application you need to point it to a running instance of `hmpps-auth`.
By default the application is configured to run against an instance running in docker that can be started
via `docker-compose`.

**NB:** It's common for developers to run against the instance of auth running in the development/T3 environment for
local development.
Most APIs don't have images with cached data that you can run with docker: setting up realistic stubbed data in sync
across a variety of services is very difficult.

### REDIS

When deployed to an environment with multiple pods we run applications with an instance of REDIS/Elasticache to provide
a distributed cache of sessions.
The template app is, by default, configured not to use REDIS when running locally.

## Developing against the template project

### Running the app via docker-compose

The easiest way to run the app is to use docker compose to create the service and all dependencies.

`docker compose pull`

`docker compose up`

### Running the app for development

To start the main services excluding the example typescript template app:

`docker compose up --scale=app=0`

Create an environment file by copying `.env.example` -> `.env`
Environment variables set in here will be available when running `start:dev`

Install dependencies using `npm install`, ensuring you are using `node v24`

Note: Using `nvm` (or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)), run `nvm install --latest-npm` within the repository folder
to use the correct version of node, and the latest version of npm. This matches the `engines` config in `package.json`
and the github pipeline build config.

And then, to build the assets and start the app with esbuild:

`npm run start:dev`

### Logging in with a test user

Once the application is running you should then be able to login with:

username: AUTH_USER
password: password123456

To request specific users and roles then raise a PR
to [update the seed data](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-auth/blob/main/src/main/resources/db/dev/data/auth/V900_3__users.sql)
for the in-memory DB used by Auth

### Installing dependencies

By default no pre or post install scripts will be run during `npm install`.
Instead a list of configured install scripts will be run via the [npm script allowlist](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-typescript-lib/tree/main/packages/npm-script-allowlist) tool.

Instead of running `npm install`, run `npm run setup` - this will run an `npm ci` to install any dependencies and then run any configured install scripts.

### Making changes

The [hmpps precommit hooks library](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-typescript-lib/tree/main/packages/precommit-hooks) will ensure that [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/cli/) is installed and initialised against the repo as part of `npm run setup`.

This will run a set of precommit hooks before every commit as configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
This will scan for potential secrets in the staged files and fail the commit if any are detected.

There's some guidance for dealing with false positives in the [precommit hooks docs](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-typescript-lib/tree/main/packages/precommit-hooks#dealing-with-false-positives).

The secret scanner hook can also be configured as described [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/devsecops-hooks?tab=readme-ov-file#-configuration).

### Run linter

- `npm run lint` runs `eslint`.
- `npm run typecheck` runs the TypeScript compiler `tsc`.

### Run all tests

The `./run_tests.sh` script automatically sets up the environment and runs both the unit and integration test suites.

```sh
./run_tests.sh
```

### Manual test setup
If you prefer to run the test suites individually follow the sections below.

#### Run unit tests

`npm run test`

#### Running integration tests

For local running, start a wiremock instance by:

`docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up`

Then run the server in test mode by:

`npm run start-feature` (or `npm run start-feature:dev` to run with auto-restart on changes)

After first install ensure playwright is initialised:

`npm run int-test-init:ci`

And then either, run tests in headless mode with:

`npm run int-test`

Or run tests with the UI:

`npm run int-test-ui`

## Keeping your app up-to-date with the template

While there are multiple ways to keep your project up-to-date this [method](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C69NWE339/p1694009011413449) doesn't require you to keep cherry picking the changes, however if that works for you there is no reason to stop.

In your service, add the template as a remote:

`git remote add template https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-template-typescript`

Create a branch and switch to it, eg:

`git checkout -b template-changes-2309`

Fetch all remotes:

`git fetch --all`

Merge the changes from the template into your service source:

`git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories`

You'll need to manually handle the merge of the changes, but if you do it early, carefully, and regularly, it won't be too much of a hassle.
